ðŸš¢ Versioning
=============

We use SemVer_ for versioning Transformer.

.. _SemVer: http://semver.org/

All user-facing changes are tracked in our :ref:`changelog`.

Only the most recent version is supported: bugs in *older* releases are
unlikely to be fixed if they don't exist in the most recent release.

For all available releases, see the `releases page`_.

.. _release-process:

Release process
---------------

Since :issue:`28`, a **new release** of Transformer is created **for each
merge** in the ``master`` branch.
Therefore, **every pull request** needs to **update the following files**:

:file:`pyproject.toml`
  â†’ Update the ``version`` field.

:file:`docs/Changelog.rst`
  â†’ Create a new section describing what changed in the new version.

:file:`docs/conf.py`
  â†’ Update the ``version`` and ``release`` fields.

Each step is described in more details in :ref:`manual-release-process`.
We also provide a best-effort :ref:`assisted-release-process` to simplify the
whole operation.

.. _assisted-release-process:

Assisted process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reduce the number of things you have to manually change, you can run **one
of**:

- ``make prepare-patch``

- ``make prepare-minor``

- ``make prepare-major``

depending on whether the new release is a *patch*, *minor*, or *major* release
(according to the SemVer_ model).
This computes the new version number for you and tries to update the
corresponding files.

.. warning::

   ``make prepare-...`` overwrites your files using patch_.
   We recommend that you **commit your changes before running it**, so that you
   can easily revert its effects if necessary.
   This is particularly important if your own changes affect one of the files
   mentioned in :ref:`release-process` (e.g. you already edited the changelog).

.. note::

   The ``make prepare-...`` script **may not always work**.
   If some of the files listed in :ref:`release-process` have changed too much
   since it was updated, it will not be able to patch them properly.
   In that case, please proceed manually as described in
   :ref:`manual-release-process`.

Manual process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose the new version
''''''''''''''''''''''

The identifier of the new release must follow the :samp:`v{X}.{Y}.{Z}` format
(where *X*, *Y*, and *Z* are integers), but the actual values for *X*, *Y* and
*Z* totally depend on what has changed since the previous release.

- When you make **incompatible API changes**, **increment X** and set *Y* and
  *Z* to 0.

- Otherwise, when you **add functionality** in a **backwards-compatible**
  manner, **increment Y** and set *Z* to 0.

- Otherwise, when you make **backwards-compatible bug fixes**, **increment Z**.

In doubt, please refer to SemVer_, which is the source of these guidelines.

Update pyproject.toml
'''''''''''''''''''''

In :file:`pyproject.toml`, update the ``version`` value to ``X.Y.Z``.

.. code-block:: diff

     [tool.poetry]
     name = "har-transformer"
   - version = "A.B.C"
   + version = "X.Y.Z"

Update the Sphinx config
''''''''''''''''''''''''

In :file:`docs/conf.py`, update the ``version`` and ``release`` fields:

.. code-block:: diff

     # The short X.Y version
   - version = "A.B"
   + version = "X.Y"
     # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
   - release = "A.B.C"
   + release = "X.Y.Z"

Update the changelog
''''''''''''''''''''

Releasing a new version requires updating the :ref:`changelog` file to tell
users **what has changed** since the last version in **clear, concise and
accessible** terms.
The git history is often not suited for this.

Assuming the current stable version is ``vA.B.C`` and new version is
``vX.Y.Z``, you need to add a new "vX.Y.Z" section at the top of the file, just
after the introduction.
This new section should mention a release date and a GitHub link to observe
the actual code changes since the last release.

This is summarized by this patch:

.. code-block:: diff

   +.. _vX.Y.Z:
   +
   +vX.Y.Z
   +======
   +
   +- Release date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
   +- Diff__.
   +
   +__ https://github.com/zalando-incubator/transformer/compare/vA.B.C...vX.Y.Z
   +
    .. _vA.B.C:

    vA.B.C
    ======

Don't forget to **update the release date!**
